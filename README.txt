DAV Public School, Jamui — Digital Library (static)
-----------------------------------------------------
Files included:
- index.html        : Main page
- style.css         : Styles
- script.js         : Client-side demo search and sample data
- assets/logo.png   : Generated placeholder logo (replace with official logo.png if available)
- assets/photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, photo3.jpg : Placeholder school photos (replace with real photos)

How to publish on GitHub Pages (quick):
1) Create a new public repository on GitHub (e.g. davjamui-digital-library).
2) Upload all files and folders from this ZIP to the repository root.
   - On GitHub: Add file -> Upload files (or push via git)
3) In repository Settings -> Pages:
   - Source: Deploy from branch 'main' (or 'master'), folder: / (root).
4) Save. GitHub will provide a URL like https://<yourusername>.github.io/<repo-name>/
5) Visit the URL to see the site live.

Notes for replacing images:
- To use official logo: replace 'assets/logo.png' with your PNG file (same name).
- Replace assets/photo1.jpg ... with your provided campus photos to show in hero.

If you want, I can:
- Provide step-by-step screenshots for GitHub upload.
- Push this project to a GitHub repo for you (if you give repo access details).
- Convert the site to use a small backend for searchable database later.
